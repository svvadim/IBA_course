Mismanaged foreign monopolistic utility firms
Should always be made public before we all burn
For the cost of heating we take another beating
Our wills are now seething, when will we all learn
Civic societies are burgeoning in the world
We don't want to be the bitch of any superpowers
Color revolutions fade, we want cheap power
Electric, electric, electric
Electric Yerevan
We say no to corruption and no to plunder
Billionaire playgrounds are going under
Electric, electric, electric
Electric Yerevan
Brutal police crackdowns with water cannons
Serve to irrigate the seeds of discontent and malcontent
Civil disobedience working like a charm
We don't want to be the bitch of any superpowers
Color revolutions fade, we want cheap power
Electric, electric, electric
Electric Yerevan
We say no to corruption and no to plunder
Billionaire playgrounds are going under
Electric, electric, electric
Electric Yerevan
It seems like the brutal police crackdown with water cannons
And beating up people including journalists
Has predictably brought more people out into the streets of Yerevan today
This was a peaceful sit in
The police had the right to clear it and legally detain people without using undue force
The situation should not be politicized by foreign media or governments
This is a non-political reaction to an endemic economic marginalization
Of a large segment of the Armenian populace
The government of Armenia should make every effort
To ameliorate the economic suffering of its citizens
Fists up
We don't want to be the bitch of any superpowers
Color revolutions fade, we want cheap power
Electric, electric, electric
Electric Yerevan
We say no to corruption and no to plunder
Billionaire playgrounds are going under
Electric, electric, electric
Electric Yerevan
Mismanaged foreign monopolistic utility firms
Should always be made public before we all burn
For the cost of heating we take another beating
